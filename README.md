# Hi! My name is Justin 👋

I'm a Software Engineering student @ the University of Waterloo. I'm joining [IMC Trading](https://www.imc.com/us) in Chicago next summer. Check out some of my work here, or view more links on my [website](https://justin-lin.com)!

- 🚗 I was most recently at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) working on software.
- 🌲 Before that, I spent two internship terms at [Zynga Inc.](https://www.zynga.com/). One was on the Platform Machine Learning team, and the other was on Zynga Poker. I worked on real-time data pipelines and monitoring systems for some of Zynga's largest ML models in production. I also worked on microservices in Go.
- 🛠️ I lead [Waterloo Reality Labs](https://uwrealitylabs.com/), the only collegiate design group in the world to be building in-house headsets from the ground up. We are interested in building new interfaces for the virtual world. I am currently directing the [Universal Gestures](https://uwrealitylabs.com/projects/universalgestures) and [Universal Text](https://uwrealitylabs.com/projects/universaltext) projects, and am working on R&D for the **Humanoid Software** subteam.
