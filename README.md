# Hi! My name is Justin ðŸ‘‹

I'm a first-year Software Engineering student @ the University of Waterloo. My side projects mostly relate to game dev, although I'm passionate about many other areas of tech which I'm excited to gain more experience in. Check out some of my work here, and on my [Itch.io page](https://justinlin905.itch.io/)!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently in my 1B term of Software Eng, a cross-discipline program that combines Computer Science and Computer/Electrical Engineering. Some courses I'm studying include `CS138: Intro to Data Abstraction and Implementation` and `ECE124: Digitial Circuits and Systems`.
