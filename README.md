# Hi! My name is Justin ðŸ‘‹

I'm a second-year Software Engineering student @ the University of Waterloo. My side projects mostly relate to 3D software development, although I'm passionate about many other areas of tech such as AI/ML and software-hardware interaction. Check out some of my work here, or view more links on my [website](https://justin-lin.com)!

- ðŸŒ± I just finished my first co-op term working as a Developer at **ArenaX Labs**. I worked on their new fighting game [AI Arena](https://aiarena.io/#/), where players train their own AI models using engaging visual tools... and then pit them against each other online!
