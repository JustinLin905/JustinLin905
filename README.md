# Hi! My name is Justin 👋

I'm a second-year Software Engineering student @ the University of Waterloo. My side projects mostly relate to 3D software development, although I'm passionate about many other areas of tech such as AI/ML and software-hardware interaction. Check out some of my work here, and on my [Itch.io page](https://justinlin905.itch.io/)!

- 🌱 I’m currently on my first co-op term working as a Developer at **ArenaX Labs**. I'm working on their new fighting game [AI Arena](https://aiarena.io/#/), where players train their own AI models using engaging visual tools... and then pit them against each other online!
