# Hi! My name is Justin 👋

I'm a Software Engineering student @ the University of Waterloo. I'm joining [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) in Fremont this summer. Check out some of my work here, or view more links on my [website](https://justin-lin.com)!

- 🌲 I was previously at [Zynga Inc.](https://www.zynga.com/) as a Data Engineering Intern on the Platform Machine Learning team. I worked on real-time data pipelines and monitoring systems for some of Zynga's largest ML models in production.
- 🌱 I was also previously at Zynga working on Go/gRPC server code for **Zynga Poker**, the world's biggest Poker game with millions of monthly users. Some of my work includes revamping the app's rewards microservice, improving P95 response time for 79 million transactions by up to 11%, every single day.
- 🛠️ I lead [Waterloo Reality Labs](https://uwrealitylabs.com/), the only collegiate design group in the world to be building in-house headsets from the ground up. We are interested in building new interfaces for the virtual world. I am currently directing the [Universal Gestures](https://uwrealitylabs.com/projects/universalgestures) and [Universal Text](https://uwrealitylabs.com/projects/universaltext) projects, and am pursuing funding for the team to begin building **Waterloo's humanoid**.
